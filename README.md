## 📊 Report Overview

The **Power BI report** visualizes patterns and trends in a patient dataset of 768 records, categorized by risk levels:

- 🔴 **High Risk**: 63.67%
- 🟡 **Medium Risk**: 17.06%
- 🟢 **Low Risk**: 19.27%

### Key Insights:
- Patients over the age of 50 have a significantly higher risk.
- Higher **BMI** (>30) and **Glucose** levels are major contributing factors to high-risk categorization.
- Increased number of **pregnancies** is associated with elevated risk.
- Strategic health monitoring can prevent the progression from medium to high risk.
